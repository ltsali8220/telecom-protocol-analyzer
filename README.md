- Multi-tab interface for different analysis views

## üõ† Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- tkinter (usually included with Python)

### Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ltsali8220/telecom-protocol-analyzer.git
cd telecom-protocol-analyzer
Running the Application
bash
python telecom_protocol_analyzer.py
üìñ Usage
Basic Operation
Configure Target

Enter target IP address (e.g., 127.0.0.1 for testing)

Set port number (default: 2123 for GTP)

Select Protocol

Choose between GTP or SCTP analysis

Choose Analysis Type

Passive Monitoring: Observes traffic without interaction

Active Scanning: Sends test packets to identify vulnerabilities

Fuzz Testing: Sends malformed packets to test protocol robustness

Vulnerability Assessment: Comprehensive security scan

Start Analysis

Click "Start Analysis" to begin monitoring

View real-time results in different tabs

Use "Stop Analysis" to halt the process

Interpreting Results
Packet Analysis Log
INFO: Normal protocol activity

WARNING: Suspicious patterns detected

ALERT: Potential security issues

ERROR: Protocol violations or errors

Vulnerability Report
LOW: Minor issues requiring monitoring

MEDIUM: Issues that should be addressed

HIGH: Significant security concerns

CRITICAL: Immediate action required

üîí Security Testing Scenarios
GTP-Specific Tests
Message Type Validation

Verify supported GTP message types

Detect unsupported or malformed messages

Sequence Number Analysis

Identify sequence number prediction attempts

Detect replay attacks

Tunnel Management

Monitor PDP context creation/deletion

Detect unauthorized tunnel establishment

SCTP-Specific Tests
Chunk Validation

Verify chunk type and flag combinations

Detect malformed chunk headers

Association Security

Monitor INIT chunk parameters

Detect association hijacking attempts

Flow Control Analysis

Identify congestion control manipulation

Detect resource exhaustion attacks

üíº Use Cases
Telecom Security Teams
Pre-deployment Testing: Validate protocol implementations before production deployment

Incident Response: Analyze suspicious network traffic during security incidents

Compliance Auditing: Verify adherence to 3GPP security standards

Penetration Testers
Red Team Exercises: Identify vulnerabilities in telecom infrastructure

Security Assessment: Comprehensive testing of GTP/SCTP implementations

Network Engineers
Protocol Debugging: Identify and troubleshoot protocol issues

Performance Monitoring: Analyze protocol efficiency and reliability

üìä Output and Reporting
The application provides:

Real-time analysis logs with timestamps

Detailed vulnerability reports with severity ratings

Protocol statistics and risk assessment

Exportable results in JSON format

‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
Simulation Mode: Current implementation uses simulated data for demonstration

Protocol Depth: Focuses on GTP and SCTP; other telecom protocols not covered

Performance: For high-traffic environments, consider optimized C++ implementations

üîÆ Future Enhancements
Integration with actual packet capture libraries (Scapy)

Support for additional telecom protocols (DIAMETER, SIP)

Automated exploit testing capabilities

Real-time traffic generation for testing

Cloud-based distributed analysis

‚ö†Ô∏è Security Disclaimer
This tool is intended for:

Authorized security testing

Educational purposes

Telecom infrastructure protection

Always ensure you have proper authorization before testing any network infrastructure.
