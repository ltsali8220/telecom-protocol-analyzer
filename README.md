  - GTPv1 and GTPv2 message parsing
  - Echo request/response monitoring
  - PDP context management analysis
- **SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) Analysis**
  - Chunk type identification (INIT, DATA, SACK, etc.)
  - Verification tag validation
  - Association management monitoring

### Security Testing Capabilities
1. **Passive Monitoring**
   - Real-time packet analysis
   - Protocol compliance checking
   - Anomaly detection

2. **Active Scanning**
   - Protocol fuzz testing
   - Boundary value analysis
   - Stress testing

3. **Vulnerability Assessment**
   - Buffer overflow detection
   - Sequence number analysis
   - Replay attack identification
   - Flooding attempt detection

### GUI Features
- Real-time packet analysis log with color-coded alerts
- Vulnerability reporting with severity levels
- Protocol statistics and risk assessment
- Export capabilities for analysis results
- Multi-tab interface for different analysis views

## üõ† Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- tkinter (usually included with Python)

### Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ltsali8220/telecom-protocol-analyzer.git
cd telecom-protocol-analyzer
```

### Running the Application
```bash
python telecom_protocol_analyzer.py
```

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Operation

#### Configure Target
- Enter target IP address (e.g., `127.0.0.1` for testing)
- Set port number (default: `2123` for GTP)

#### Select Protocol
- Choose between GTP or SCTP analysis

#### Choose Analysis Type
- **Passive Monitoring**: Observes traffic without interaction
- **Active Scanning**: Sends test packets to identify vulnerabilities
- **Fuzz Testing**: Sends malformed packets to test protocol robustness
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Comprehensive security scan

#### Start Analysis
- Click **Start Analysis** to begin monitoring
- View real-time results in different tabs
- Use **Stop Analysis** to halt the process

### Interpreting Results

#### Packet Analysis Log
- `INFO`: Normal protocol activity
- `WARNING`: Suspicious patterns detected
- `ALERT`: Potential security issues
- `ERROR`: Protocol violations or errors

#### Vulnerability Report
- `LOW`: Minor issues requiring monitoring
- `MEDIUM`: Issues that should be addressed
- `HIGH`: Significant security concerns
- `CRITICAL`: Immediate action required

## üîí Security Testing Scenarios

### GTP-Specific Tests
- **Message Type Validation**: Verify supported GTP message types, detect unsupported or malformed messages
- **Sequence Number Analysis**: Identify sequence number prediction attempts, detect replay attacks
- **Tunnel Management**: Monitor PDP context creation/deletion, detect unauthorized tunnel establishment

### SCTP-Specific Tests
- **Chunk Validation**: Verify chunk type and flag combinations, detect malformed chunk headers
- **Association Security**: Monitor INIT chunk parameters, detect association hijacking attempts
- **Flow Control Analysis**: Identify congestion control manipulation, detect resource exhaustion attacks

## üíº Use Cases

### Telecom Security Teams
- Pre-deployment Testing: Validate protocol implementations before production deployment
- Incident Response: Analyze suspicious network traffic during security incidents
- Compliance Auditing: Verify adherence to 3GPP security standards

### Penetration Testers
- Red Team Exercises: Identify vulnerabilities in telecom infrastructure
- Security Assessment: Comprehensive testing of GTP/SCTP implementations

### Network Engineers
- Protocol Debugging: Identify and troubleshoot protocol issues
- Performance Monitoring: Analyze protocol efficiency and reliability

## üìä Output and Reporting
The application provides:
- Real-time analysis logs with timestamps
- Detailed vulnerability reports with severity ratings
- Protocol statistics and risk assessment
- Exportable results in JSON format

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
- **Simulation Mode**: Current implementation uses simulated data for demonstration
- **Protocol Depth**: Focuses on GTP and SCTP; other telecom protocols not covered
- **Performance**: For high-traffic environments, consider optimized C++ implementations

## üîÆ Future Enhancements
- Integration with actual packet capture libraries (Scapy)
- Support for additional telecom protocols (DIAMETER, SIP)
- Automated exploit testing capabilities
- Real-time traffic generation for testing
- Cloud-based distributed analysis

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Disclaimer
This tool is intended for:
- Authorized security testing
- Educational purposes
- Telecom infrastructure protection

**Always ensure you have proper authorization before testing any network infrastructure.**
